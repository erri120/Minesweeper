# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and has been written for manz computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and offshoots.

This is one of those variations and my personal take on the game. I made this using the Godot Game Engine to learn the engine. If you want to loose some brain cells and play a poorly written game, than please download the release and be happy.
